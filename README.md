# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis 

## Obejctive 
Instacart, a grocery store, operates through an app and is currently having good sales. In order to uncover more information about their sales patters, they have asked me to perform an initial exploratory analysis and suggest stategies for a better segmentation of their products. 

## Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ?
